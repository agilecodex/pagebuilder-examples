# Page Builder - ThemeKit (Deprecated)

As of [Page Builder version 1.6.0](https://devdocs.magento.com/page-builder/docs/release-notes.html), released with Magento Commerce 2.4.2, this is a completely outdated example module for integrating a theme into Page Builder.

Themes can now be integrated easily using the new [Styling features](https://devdocs.magento.com/page-builder/docs/styles/introduction.html) in Page Builder 1.6.0.
