# PageBuilder- Base Form Extensions

This example module shows you how to remove fields and fieldsets from Page Builder's built-in forms. Page Builder uses two forms to provide fieldsets and fields to all its content types:

*  `Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/ui_component/pagebuilder_base_form.xml`
*  `Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/ui_component/pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes.xml`

The `pagebuilder_base_form.xml` provides the Advanced fieldset and all its fields (such as alignments, borders, margins and paddings).
The `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes.xml` provides the Background fieldset and all its fields (such as background images, sizes, and positions).

As this example shows, you can _globally_ remove the fields or fieldsets from these base forms by adding same-named XML files to your module. Within these files, you simply add the field or fieldset you want to remove by nesting the `componentDisabled` setting. For example, to remove the border radius field:

```xml
<field name="border_radius">
    <argument name="data" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="config" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="componentDisabled" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
        </item>
    </argument>
</field>
```

## Installation and usage

To install this extension module:

1. Copy the `BaseForms` directory and all its contents into the `app/code/` directory.
2. Command line into your `<magento-root>` directory and run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install the extension.
3. Navigate to a Page Builder instance, open the editor for an existing content type (Row, for example) and view the altered form with the removed fields / fieldsets.
