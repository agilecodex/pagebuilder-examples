# PageBuilderExtensionSlider

Under the hood, the Page Builder Slider uses the [slick carousel](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick). In this example, we show you how to add two [slick settings](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/#settings) not included in the native Page Builder Slider: `centerMode` and `centerPadding`, as shown here:

## Installation and usage

To install this extension module:

1. Copy the `Slider` directory and all its contents into the `app/code/` directory.
2. Command line into your `<magento-root>` directory and run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install the extension.
3. Navigate to a Page Builder instance, drag a Slider onto the Admin stage, and add at least three Slides.
4. Open the Slider Editor, turn on the **Center Mode** setting, and adjust the **Center Padding** as desired.
5. **Save** the form settings and view your new center-mode Slider in action.
