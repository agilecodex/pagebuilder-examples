# Page Builder Text Extension

Under the hood, the Page Builder Text content type uses the [TinyMCE WYSIWYG HTML Editor](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/). In this example, we show you how to:

* Add and remove buttons from the [TinyMCE toolbar](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/advanced/editor-control-identifiers/#toolbarcontrols) 
* Integrate your theme's typography into the [TinyMCE Formats selector](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-formatting/#formattype)
* Add the [TinyMCE code plugin](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/code/) (< >) to the toolbar so you can view the HTML code directly.
