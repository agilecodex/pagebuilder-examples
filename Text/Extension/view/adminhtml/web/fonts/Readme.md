## Simulated theme fonts

These fonts are only included in this example module to _simulate_ fonts from your theme.
Normally, overriding the TinyMCE Formats (`h1-h6`, `p`, and other styles) with your own theme fonts is just a matter of using your theme's font-family names within your theme's `h1-h6` and `p` styles.

In this example module, our theme font-family is Poppins, downloaded here to keep this module self-contained.
