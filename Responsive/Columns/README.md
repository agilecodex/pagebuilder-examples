# Responsive Columns

This module provides a Page Builder example module that shows how to use breakpoints to create responsive columns. Almost every file in the module is annotated with comments that explain what the code and configurations do, so you can learn how to take full control of Page Builder columns for your content.

## Installation

1. Add this module to the `app/code/` directory in your Magento instance.

1. Run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install it.

## What it does

It does quite a bit. I'll add all the details soon. But until then, you can read the comments within the module files to get a pretty good idea of the things it does. Some code is only there to fix bugs in 1.6.0. A good example is the `StageConfigFix` plugin. This fixes a configuration bug with the `stage` configuration for viewports. More to come.
